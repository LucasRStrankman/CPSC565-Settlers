This is an Evolutionary Strategy to find the optimal settlement locations on a Catan board
by looking at Resource types, Resource outputs, and Distance to the build point

SETUP
This uses a bashscript to call Netlogo-headless from inside a python script,
so you must be running a Unix system to operate

To run you must first install Netlogo and Java. Then open up ES-Catan.py and 
put in the absolute path to your Netlogo installation and the location for the
Catan Netlogo model

Afterwards you can call "python ES-Catan.py" to start it running.
You may see the console output 
"JAVA_HOME undefined, using java from path. For control over exact java version, set JAVA_HOME"
The ES will still run properly, this is given by netlogo-headless. To remove this warning
follow the steps given on the Netlogo Behaviour Space documentation to add a 
JAVA_HOME variable

The ES will output the values of each run to a csv to see for later use
